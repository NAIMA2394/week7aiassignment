# AI Development Workflow Assignment

## Course: AI for Software Engineering  
**Duration:** 7 Days  
**Total Points:** 100

## 📌 Objective
This project demonstrates the application of the **AI Development Workflow** to two real-world scenarios:
1. **Predicting student dropout rates** in secondary schools.
2. **Predicting patient readmission risk** in hospitals within 30 days.

It covers all major stages of AI development—from problem definition and data preprocessing to model deployment and ethical reflection.

## 🧠 Models Used

- **Random Forest** for dropout prediction.
- **Logistic Regression** for patient readmission classification.

Each model is selected based on its interpretability, performance, and appropriateness to the domain.

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC
- Confusion Matrix (Precision & Recall)

---

## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations

- Addressed **bias**, **fairness**, and **data privacy** concerns.
- Included **HIPAA compliance** and strategies for minimizing algorithmic discrimination.
